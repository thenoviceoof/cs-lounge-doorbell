A virtual doorbell
================================================================================

ABOUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some student spaces are inexplicably inaccessible, and making them
accessible is time consuming/weird. Instead of handing out phone
numbers, you can ring a virtual doorbell that will text the event
organizer to let ey know you've been locked out.

More of an excuse to get up to speed with sinatra and re-acquaint
myself with ruby.

Built for the CS Lounge at Columbia University.
